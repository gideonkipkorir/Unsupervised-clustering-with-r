## Problem Definition: 
Kira Plastinina is an online retail store available for customers in that wants to know the chararcteristics of their customers in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. In detail, the sales and marketing team would like to know the characteristics of the different customer groups. 
## Data Undesrtanding:

The dataset has 10 numerical and 8 categorical features. 
* Administrative“,”Administrative Duration“,”Informational“,”Informational Duration“,”Product Related" and “Product Related Duration” represents the number of different types of pages visited by the visitor in that session and total time spent in each of these page categories. 
* The value of the “Bounce Rate” feature for a web page refers to the percentage of visitors who enter the site from that page and then leave (“bounce”) without triggering any other requests to the analytics server during that session. 
* The value of the “Exit Rate” feature for a specific web page is calculated as for all pageviews to the page, the percentage that was the last in the session. 
* The “Page Value” feature represents the average value for a web page that a user visited before completing an e-commerce transaction. The “Special Day” feature indicates the closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day (e.g. Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day) in which the sessions are more likely to be finalized with the transaction. The value of this attribute is determined by considering the dynamics of e-commerce such as the duration between the order date and delivery date. For example, for Valentina’s day, this value takes a nonzero value between February 2 and February 12, zero before and after this date unless it is close to another special day, and its maximum value of 1 on February 8. 
* The dataset also includes the operating system, browser, region, traffic type, visitor type as returning or new visitor, a Boolean value indicating whether the date of the visit is weekend, and month of the year.
## The appropriateness of the data will be addressed by checking:
*	whether the data is accurate?
*	whether the dataset is enough to sufficiently address the problem at hand?
*	whether the dtaset was biased or imbalanced? 
## Experimental design:
*	loading and previewing the dataset, checking datatypes
*	Cleaning , checking for outliers
*	Conducting exploratory data analysis to find out patterns and relationships
*	Comunicating the obsertavtions and findings
*	Drawing conclusion
